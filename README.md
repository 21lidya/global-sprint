# Welcome to the 2017 Mozilla Global Sprint!

### What's the Global Sprint?
Mozilla's Global Sprint, a fun, fast-paced two-day collaborative work event to hack and build awesome open science projects. We’ll be coming together, in person and online, to work on open projects from every discipline, from around the world. 

Your open project is welcome, whether you’re creating new scientific software, working on web literacy curriculum, hacking on the Internet of Things, developing apps to protect user privacy online, planning local community events, or creating tools that make data open accessible to all. **When you bring an open project to the Sprint, you’ll be welcoming contributions from a diverse, skilled and passionate group of people from around Mozilla’s Network.**
