* [ ] In your README, link to the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) or write your own code of conduct.
* [ ] Create file: CONTRIBUTING.md so others know how they can contribute. If you'd like, you can [remix this template](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozsprint-repo-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [ ] [Fill out this form](https://www.mozillapulse.org/add) to submit your project to Mozilla Pulse. Add the tags `mozsprint` and `2018`.

Once all of the above is complete,
- [ ] Leave a comment with the text `This is ready to be featured on Mozilla Pulse`. Your wrangler will review this issue and approve your project if everything looks good :balloon:
