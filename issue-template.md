#### Requirements Checklist for FEATURED Projects :clipboard:
To have your project FEATURED on Network Pulse, complete the following documentation. In past Sprints, well-documented featured projects have had 5 times as many contributions as projects that only meet the basic requirements for project registration.

If you complete all steps, your project will be featured on [Network Pulse](http://mozillapulse.org/) during [#mozsprint 2017](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint). As you complete each exercise, check off the box and comment with a link to your completed resource. D
Details about each item and more information about how to create them are [here on our Project Requirements Page](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/project-requirements/). 
This [template repository WE NEED TO UPDATE THIS- WE ARE NOT DOING VISION STATEMENTS AND ASKING FOR SOME OTHER STUFF](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozsprint-repo-template) is here to help you if you get stuck!
* [ ] In your README, link to the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) or write your own.
* [ ] [Create file: LICENSE](http://choosealicense.com/) to give your project an open license, allowing for sharing and remixing.
* [ ] Create file: CONTRIBUTING.md so others know how they can contribute. If you'd like, you can [remix this template](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozsprint-repo-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md))
* [ ] Create a ROADMAP to let contributors know what's currently happening, the scale and scope of your planned project work. 


Once all of the above is complete,
- [ ] post to [Network Pulse](http://mozillapulse.org/) by [filling out this form (need to make form)](). We'll review this issue to approve your post :balloon: :cake:
