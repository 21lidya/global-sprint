#Mozilla Global Sprint Info for Project Leads

### The Basics
Any project entered in the sprint should:

* have a designated **project lead** who can lead the work before and during the sprint
* allow and **welcome contributions** by Sprint participants
* support the open web and a healthy internet.

In 2017 we're welcoming a wide range of projects, from security/privacy tools to scientific software to web literacy curriculum to community events-- nearly anything that supports or builds the open web. Not sure if your project is right for the sprint? See our FAQ here for more.  

### About the Project Lead Role
The Project Lead role is key for a successful run in the Global Sprint!  All Project Leads should have a good understanding of basic open practices. **We're strongly recommending that all Global Sprint Project Leads take ["Open Leadership 101,"](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101) a very short (1-hour) online course covering these concepts.**

As a Project Lead you'll need to in advance to prepare project for the Sprint.  On the day of the sprint, you will

* welcome both in-person and online contributors of all levels
* coordinate project work
* answer questions and troubleshoot
* approve contributionsa and pull requests
* be an enthusiastic, helpful, and patient presence. 

### About Welcoming Contributions
Every Global Sprint project should welcome contributions from a group of diverse, skilled and passionate people from around Mozillaâ€™s Network. Welcoming happens on-site at the Sprint,  but it's good project documentation that enables contributors understand project aims and start collaborating right away. See this checklist of required project documents for the 2017 Sprint.
