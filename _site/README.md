# Welcome to the 2017 Mozilla Global Sprint! June 1st-2nd, 2017.

### What's the Global Sprint?
Mozilla's Global Sprint, a fun, fast-paced two-day collaborative work event to hack and build awesome open projects that support and build a vibrant, healthy Internet. We’ll be coming together, in person and online, to work on open projects from every discipline, from around the world.

### Want to pitch in and contribute to an open Project at the Global Sprint?
Anyone is welcome-- you don't have to be an expert coder or technical ninja to be part of the Sprint.

**We're looking for students, educators, librarians, graphic designers and user experience designers, writers, scientists, researchers, advocates and activists, project managers, community organizers... and pretty much anyone else who's an engaged and curious user of the web, apps and tools.**

You can contribute code or content, you can do QA (quality assurance) testing on protype tools or apps, you can do proofreading or writing, visual design and graphic art, you can advise or comment on project ideas or plans from your own unique perspective. There are countless ways to  participate, and lots of cool projects to explore. Browse projects that are ready and waiting for your contribution here.


**Before you pitch in, please take a look at our resources and FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) for contributors, including a very short video to help you get started.**


### Want to bring a Project to the Global Sprint?

**When you bring an open project to the Sprint, you’ll be welcoming contributions from a diverse, skilled and passionate group of people from around Mozilla’s Network.**

Your open project is welcome, whether you’re creating new scientific software, working on web literacy curriculum, hacking on the Internet of Things, developing apps to protect user privacy online, planning local community events, or creating tools that make data open accessible to all.

**For more about preparing your project for a successful sprint, [see our resources and FAQs (Frequetly Asked Questions) for Project Leads.](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint/blob/master/projects.md)**



### Want to host a Site at the Global Sprint?

A host site is a space where people gather in person during the sprint, to work together, hang out, and network. It's a collaborative work space but also a great opportunity to meet and connect with members of your local Mozilla and open Web communities. As a site host, you help get the word out about the Sprint, and you invite and welcome people into the space. Sites can be for any number of people, from 3 to 30 or more. All you need is an accessible space, good strong Wi-Fi connection, and maybe some coffee or snacks.
