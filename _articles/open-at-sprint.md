title: "Open" at the Global Sprint
---

**The Global Sprint itself-- and all the projects we'll sprint on at the event-- are open projects.** That means these project are designed especially  for: 

* **Understanding**: open projects have clear documentation, so it’s easy to understand the project concept, goals, and process; this information is accessible to everyone
* **Participation & inclusion**: open projects invite and empower diverse contributors; anyone can volunteer their skills, knowledge and insights to shape the project
* **Sharing**: open projects are easy to adapt, reproduce, and share; open licenses state how a projects’ code or content can be reused, remixed, and distributed

These three principles make it possible-- easy, even-- for you to participate in the event, hold your own local Sprint, and make meaningful contributions to Sprint projects. Attending an open event and working on an open project is a bit different from your usual event or volunteer experience. Here’s a short video on participation on open projects from Abby Cabunoc Mayes, Developer Engagement Manager at Mozilla, from our course [Open Leadership 101](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101).

To recap, here are the 5 steps for participation on Open Projects:

* **Choose a project**: Decide what you’re most excited about. What do you want work on, or learn? Look for a project that can give you that experience.     
* **Do your research**: Take some time to get to know the project and people and understand their goals. Look for an “About” page on the project web site or the project’s README file on a collaboration platform like GitHub.     
* **Dive in!**: Most projects have little chunks of work set aside for newcomers. For your first contribution start small, and ask lots of questions.     
* **Listen to feedback**: Your work will probably be reviewed by someone else in the community-- this is a good thing! Use this time to sharpen your skills while helping the project produce quality work.     
* **Be respectful and honest**: Participation is about working together in a community. Be respectful of the ideas and perspective of others. And be honest with your new collaborators-- be realistic about what you have the time, energy and skills to do.
