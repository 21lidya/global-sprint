Welcome! We’re excited you’re participating in Mozilla’s Global Sprint. This guide explains how to find a Sprint project and collaborate at the event. If you haven't yet registered, please do so here. 

### About Sprint Participation
Participants are volunteers who offer their time and expertise to projects at the Global Sprint. As a participant, your contributions are central to the Sprint-- they can supercharge projects with new energy and ideas, and move work forward by leaps and bounds!

As a participant at the Global Sprint, you might:  

* add your own unique perspective by advising on project ideas and plans 
* help with research for content, UX or design 
* create graphics and logos, or design layouts and mock-ups
* help with QA (quality assurance) testing on prototype tools or apps
* contribute code in a variety of languages, from HTML to C++
* write or edit project content like instructions, descriptions and documentation, 
* and much more… see our list of “help wanted” categories to find a match for your skills

_Participants should be aware that their contributions to projects during the Sprint will fall under each project’s own license, and may be be reused, remixed, and shared according to that license. By registering for the Sprint, participants understand and agree that any data they provide will be handled according to Mozilla’s Privacy Policy._

### Where and When to Sprint 
In 2018, the Sprint will take place on May 10-11th, from 9am to 5pm local time, wherever you are.  You can participate at a local sprint site (if there’s one near you), where you’ll work and network with others, or you can join from your home or workplace.  If you’re sprinting virtually, simple, free tools like online chat and video conferencing will help you connect with others at the Sprint. 

You’re not required to attend both full days of the Sprint-- though you’re welcome to!  But if you do join us, be sure to allow enough Sprinting time to meaningfully contribute to a project-- usually two or three hours.

Whether you work from home or at a site, you’ll use free online collaboration tools like online chat, video conferencing, and GitHub. If you’re new to these tools, don’t worry! There is information about these tools in the section “Collaboration Tools.”
