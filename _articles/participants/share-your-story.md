Share your Sprint story!
Part of the "open" nature of the Sprint is connecting and sharing our work, processes an experiences. During the event, we encourage you to post updates-- both in the Gitter chat, and on social media. You can follow the #mozsprint hashtag on Twitter to see what Sprinters around the Globe are up to (If you're new to the Sprint, #mozsprint will give you an idea of what previous events were like).
