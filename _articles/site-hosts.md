**Site Hosts coordinate local, in-person work spaces for the Global Sprint, where contributors come together to work, network, and hang out. The Site Host also helps to promote the event within their local area. This is a great chance to meet new people and strengthen your existing community! Your site can be small--welcoming just a handful of people-- or as large as you like.** 

By registering for the Sprint, Site Hosts understand and agree that any data they provide will be handled according to [Mozilla's Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/).

* welcoming people who come to work in-person
* ensuring that your Site is a safe and friendly working environment for all
* helping to promote the Global Sprint to your commmunities and encourage local participation
* serving  as a point of contact for communicating (updates, progress) with the rest of the Sprint during the event
