### Hosting A Site at the Global Sprint
A Global Sprint site is a physical space where participants and project leads gather to work on the Sprint. A site needs good workspace for participants, and an internet connnection-- preferably good, strong Wi-Fi.

Your site can be for three people, or for 30-- it's up to you. **While the Sprint itself is a 48 hour event, you only need to be present at your site from 9 to 5 local time on both days.** 

As site host, you're responsible for welcoming people who come to work in-person, and ensuring that your Site is a safe and friendly working environment for all. **Please read and ensure you agree with Mozilla's Participation Guidelines for this event.**

Site hosts also help promote the Global Sprint to their commmunities and encourage local participation. We have a handy guide for Site hosts to help you plan your communications about the Sprint, including template emails and sample social media and blog posts.  We'll also send you fun Global Sprint related swag (stickers, etc) to distribute to your communities.
