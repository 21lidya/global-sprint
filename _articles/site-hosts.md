**Site Hosts coordinate local, in-person work spaces where contributors come together to work, network, and hang out during the Global Sprint. As Site Host, you'll also help to promote the event within your local area. 

**FUEL YOUR SPRINT! WE'LL BUY THE FIRST 50 SITES TO REGISTER COFFEE! (limit $50 USD per site)**

This is a great chance to meet new people and strengthen your existing community! Your site can be small -- welcoming just a handful of people -- or as large as you like. Before you register as a host, check to see if there's already a site in your local area. [Our site list is here](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/register/).

By registering for the Sprint, Site Hosts understand and agree that any data they provide will be handled according to [Mozilla's Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/).

### Hosting a site at the Global Sprint

A Global Sprint site is a physical space where participants and project leads gather to work on the Sprint. A site needs good workspace for participants and an internet connnection -- preferably good, strong Wi-Fi. Your site can be for three people, or for 30 or more, it's up to you. **While the Sprint itself is a 48 hour event, we only expect you to be sprinting between 9am to 5pm local time. Ideally your site would be open from 9am-5pm on both days, but it's fine if your site can only be open on one full day, or in the afternoon or morning. Note your exact Site hours on your registration form** 

As site host, you're responsible for 
* welcoming people who come to work in-person
* ensuring that your site is a safe and friendly working environment for all
* helping to promote the Global Sprint to your commmunities and encourage local participation
* serving as a point of contact for communicating (updates, progress) with the rest of the Sprint during the event
* helping to collect data on activities at the site (# of partcipants and contributions)


### Frequently Asked Questions (for Site Hosts)


**Q: What space can be a site? Can my house, living room, or garage be a site? 

A: Any space that has comfortable capacity for your attendees and has good WiFi or an internet connection is appropriate! Yes, your home can be a site but keep in mind the Sprint is a public event. Be sure you're comfortable with Sprint participants who you may not know they are coming to your home to work. 


**Q: I want to host a site, but I don't have my own space. What kinds of spaces should I look for?**

A: We recommend a relatively quiet space (busy coffee shops aren't the greatest). To bring on participants from a certain community (like a university) pick a site near or co-located with that community (a classroom or student center).  Libraries, community centers, hackerspaces-- all these make good sites. It's up to you as site host to define a space with the desired vibe and accommodations for your attendees. We can provide a letter of affiliation with Mozilla if you need it to secure a free site.

**Q: What kind of resources are available to support my site?**

A: We'll send swag packs to the first 50 sites to register that provide a mailing address, including stickers, nametags, and small posters. We also will provide digital files if you'd like to print out some of these materials on site. 

**Q: How does my site and the work we are doing connect to the rest of the Sprint?**

A: Each site is a home base for local community members to collaborate in-person during the sprint. Each site is also linked to other sites in the region. We'll have daily video conference check-ins for sites in the same time zone so you can meet other participants and hear about project work underway.

**Q: What do I need to provide to be a successful site? 

A: Each site should have working WiFi or Internet connection, chairs and tables to support 10-20 participants comfortably (more if desired). That's it!

**Q: Should I provide food or drinks?**

Providing snacks or coffee is not required, but is appreciated by participants. If the site is at a local company or university, sometimes that institution will donate refreshments for medium-sized events. We recommend looking into donation options from local businesses, and having coffee on hand to support and energize attendees.
 

**Q: What are ways I can promote my site? How can I get more people beyond those I already know (or those involved in my project) to come to my site?**

A: We recommend sharing info about your site on social media networks (Twitter, Facebook). Send out emails to colleagues, friends, and any lists youâ€™re on. You can also make posters and distribute postcards using easy-to-edit templates that will be emailed to you in advance. To get the most participants, start advertising early! Get the word out well in advance of the event so people have time to learn about it and make plans to attend.
