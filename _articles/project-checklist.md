title: "More About the Project Checklist"
---

When you fill out a project application form, you'll receive a response with a link to a GitHub issue, containing a template for you to fill out with project information. You'll also see a **checklist of project documents** you'll need for the Global Sprint.

**If you're new to working open and collaborating online, see below for info about each document, and why it's important for the Sprint.**

## Project Requirements
1. **A GitHub Repository.**
GitHub is an online, easy-to-use online platform for collaborative work and managing changes to code and content. A repository is your collection of project files (code,content) on GitHub. You DON'T need to be an expert in GitHub (or the version control software Git that powers it) to set up a repository, add project documentation, and create "issues" or chunks of work that participants can help with. We offer some basic tutorials as well as [complete lessons on using GitHub](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/introducing-github-for-collaborative-work-and-version-control/).

2. **A README File.**
The README is your go-to project documentation file. The README explains what the project is, why the work is important, and how work currently underway supports the project goals. Your README should be written to be understandable to newcomers who might not be experts in your field or programming language, but still want to pitch in! If you're not sure where to start with your README, [refer to this lesson](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/), part of our Open Leadership Training Series.

3. **Contributor Guidelines.**
These Guidelines tell potential contributors exactly HOW they can help-- from the format and style for any contributions to  the steps required for submission and approval. Without this document, contributors won't know how to help out, so Contributor Guidelines are **very very important.** For more info on how to write our own Guidelines [check out this lesson](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/).

4. **Code of Conduct/Participation Guideline.s**
This document outlines shared values and norms that contributors agree to when they join a  project community. Good Codes of Conduct should highlight positive community behaviors, like cooperation and honesty, as well as describing the negative behaviors that are not permitted, like harrassment or descrimination. A good CoC encourages contribution by letting contributors know they'll be treated respectfully. For an example, look at Mozilla's Participation Guidelines (and feel free to reuse and remix it for your project). If you need help writing your own CoC, [refer to this lesson](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-a-code-of-conduct/). 

5. **Roadmap.**
A Roadmap is an outline of project work that's currently underway, and work that's upcoming. It helps contributors understand project plans and project scope. Your roadmap should include "milestones," which are important chunks of work you are planning (like features, units of curriculum, or stages in event planning). If you need more info on writing a Roadmap, [refer to this lesson](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/).

6. **License**
A license indicates to the world how exactly your project is open-- how the code, content, curriculum, or design of an event can be used, distributed, resused, and remixed by others. If you need more info about choosing a license, [refer to this lesson](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/sharing-your-work-in-the-open/).  

7. **Issue Tracker.**
The issue tracker is a GitHub feature that allows you to describe tasks or chunks of work, or "issues". Others can comment on an issue to discuss the work. You can assign an issue to a contributor, add tags to add extra information or categories to the work(like "new feature" "help wanted" "good first bug"), and you can link milestone info to an issue to help prioritze work. "Open"" issues are work that needs to be done or is underway. "Closed" issues are work that's completed. 

## Optional Items-- Complete to become a "Featured"" Project

1. Vision Statement 
By coming up with a super short, clear statement about what you're doing and why, you can become a better communicator and increase interest and contributor involvement with your open project. This [quick exericse](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/stating-your-project-vision/) helps you create a polished statmement. 
2. Open Canvas 
Open Canvas is a one-page planning tool designed specifically for open projects, modeled on a business plan format used in the start-up world. Creating an Open Canvas can help you think strategically about your project. Our [Open Canvas lesson is here](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/develop-an-open-project-strategy-with-open-canvas/). 
3. Personas Exercise
A persona is a profile of a potential contributor or user, which you can use to design a welcoming and easy process for partcipation on your open project. Personas are great tool to help you understand your community and grow it to sustain your project. [Our exercise on personas is here.](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/)
