title: "Project Checklist"
---

When you fill out a project application form, you'll receive a response with a link to a GitHub issue, containing a template for you to fill out with project information. You'll also see a checklist of project documents you'll need for the Global Sprint.

**If you're new to working open and collaborationg online, see below for info about each document, and why it's important for the Sprint.**

## Project Requirements
1. **A GitHub Repository.**
GitHub is an online, easy-to-use online platform for collaborative work and managing changes to code and content. A repository is your collection of project files (code,content) on GitHub. You DON'T need to be an expert in GitHub (or the version control software Git that powers it) to set up a repository, add project documentation, and create "issues" or chunks of work that participants can help with. We offer some basic tutorials as well as complete lessons on using GitHub.

2. **A README File.**
The README is your go-to project documentation file. The README explains what the project is, why the work is important, and how work currently underway supports the project goals. Your README orients contributors to the project, and should be written to be understandable to newcomers who might not be experts in your field or programming language, but still have lots to offer. If you're not sure where to start with your README, [you can refer to this lesson](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/), part of our Open Leadership Training Series.

3. **Contributor Guidelines.**
These guidelines tell potential contributors exactly HOW they can help-- from the format and style for any contributions to  the steps required for submission and approval. Without this document, contributors won't know how to help out or where to begin, so it's **very very important** to have Contributor Guidelines for the Sprint! If you're not sure what to put in your Contributor Guidelines, you can refer to this lesson, part of our Open Leadership Training Series.

4. **Code of Conduct/Participation Guideline.s**
This document outlines shared values and norms that contributors should agree to when they decide to join a given project community. Good Codes of Conduct should highlight positive community behaviors and values, like cooperation and honesty, as well as the describing negative or damaging behaviors, like harrassment or descrimination, that are forbidden. A good CoC encourages contribution by letting potential contributors know they'll be treated respectfully. Mozilla's Participation Guidelines are here, and Mozilla Science Lab's Code of Conduct is here. If you need help getting started, take a look at this lesson in our Open Leadership Training Series.

5. **Roadmap.**
A Roadmap is an outline of project work that's currently underway, and work that's upcoming. It helps contributors underestand project plans and project scope. A roadmap should include "milestones," which are important chunks of work (like features, or units of curriculum, or stages in event planning) that move your project toward its end goal. If you need more info on writing a Roadmap [you can refer to this lesson](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/), part of our Open Leadership Training Series.

6. **Issue Tracker.**
The issue tracker is a GitHub feature that allows you to describe tasks or chunks of work, or "issues". Others can comment on an issue to discuss the work. You can assign an issue to a contributor, add tags to add extra information or categories to the work(like "new feature" "help wanted" "good first bug"), and you can link milestone info to an issue to help prioritze work. "Open"" issues are work that needs to be done or is underway. "Closed" issues are work that's completed. For more about issues, see...
