**Participants browse our list of awesome projects, and pick a project (or two) to work on during the Sprint. They can join the Sprint online, from wherever they are, or they can head to a local site during the Sprint to meet, work and network with others. All skill levels are welcome, and you don't have to commit to being at the entire Sprint-- drop in for two hours or two days, whatever works for you!**

### Welcome to your Global Sprint experience!
There are  countless ways for you to participate... You can contribute code or content, you can do QA (quality assurance) testing on protype tools or apps, you can do proofreading or writing, visual design and graphic art, you can advise or comment on project ideas or plans from your own unique perspective...  **We're very excited to have you as an active participant in this year's Sprint!** Here's more on participation on open projects from Abby Cabunoc Mayes, Developer Engagement at Mozilla.

### Finding Tasks and Making Contributions
During the Sprint, you'll contact the Lead on the project you'd like to work on, and volunteer to help out with a task. Be sure to ask any questions you have, and then get to work! When you've completed your task, you'll submit your work for review by the Project Lead, who'll provide, feedback, comments, gratitude... and if all goes well, the Project Lead will incorporate your work into the project. Yay!

At the Sprint, you'll probably browse project tasks, called "Issues", in an online collaboration platform called GitHub. Some projects will have their code and content there in GitHub as well; some will be working with other collaboration tools, like Google Docs or Etherpad. 

If the project you choose is working primarily on GitHub, you may find it helpful to open a free account on GitHub. This is easy, quick, and, again free! Once you have an account, you can comment on issues and the project lead can add you on tasks. You can also add your changes to the code or content using GitHub. For more on how to use GitHub at the Global Sprint, see these two short, beginner friendly videos **(COMING SOON).**
