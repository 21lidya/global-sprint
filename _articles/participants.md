**Participants browse our list of awesome projects, and pick a project (or two) to work on during the Sprint. You can join the Sprint online from wherever you happen to be or head to a local host site during the Sprint to meet, work, and network with others. All skill levels are welcome and you don't have to commit to being at the entire Sprint-- drop in for two hours or two days, whatever works for you!** 

This year we're Sprinting on projects that promote, protect and build the open Web, in line with Mozilla's key issues for Internet health.  

* **OPEN INNOVATION**: projects that help anyone publish or invent online without asking permission and/or ensure that technologies used to run the Web are transparent and understandable.
* **PRIVACY & SECURITY**: projects that support our ability to understand what is happening to our data online, and our ability to control how that data is used.
* **DIGITAL INCLUSION**: projects that help ensure that everyone has equal opportunity to access the Internet and can use it to improve their lives and societies.
* **WEB LITERACY**: projects that promote or teach the skills to read, write, and participate in the digital world-- and the ability to shape (not just consume) the Web.
* **DECENTRALIZATION**: projects that help protect and secure an Internet controlled by many so, that no one actor can own it or control it or switch it off.

Participants should be aware that their contributions to projects during the Sprint will fall under each project's own license, and may be  be reused, remixed, and shared according to that license. By registering for the Sprint, participants understand and agree that any data they provide will be handled according to [Mozilla's Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/).

### Register to participate in the Global Sprint, in 4 easy steps!

* **WATCH** the short video and **READ** the short sections below. If you'd like to know more about collaboration for the open web, we recommend this *optional*, 1-hour course, ["Open Leadership 101"](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101).
* **BROWSE** our [Featured Projects](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/) and check out our [full list of all registered Sprint projects](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint/issues) to discover a project that you'd like to work on
* When our [Site List]() is available (later this Spring) **CHECK OUT** the list to find an in-person site to Sprint with others, if you'd like. Of course, you can also join us online wherever you have internet access.
* When [Registration]() is open (later this Spring), **REGISTER** as a paraticipant so we know to expect you!

There are countless ways for you to participate... 
* You can contribute code or content
* You can do QA (quality assurance) testing on protype tools or apps
* You can do proofreading or writing, visual design and graphic art
* You can advise or comment on project ideas or plans from your own unique perspective...  

Here's more on participation on open projects from Abby Cabunoc Mayes, Developer Engagement Manager at Mozilla.

### Finding Tasks and Making Contributions
During the Sprint, you'll contact the Lead on the project you'd like to work on, and volunteer to help out with a task. Be sure to ask any questions you have, and then get to work! When you've completed your task, you'll submit your work for review by the Project Lead, who'll provide, feedback, comments, gratitude... and if all goes well, the Project Lead will incorporate your work into the project. Yay!

At the Sprint, you'll probably browse project tasks, called "Issues", in an online collaboration platform called GitHub. Some projects will have their code and content there in GitHub as well; some will be working with other collaboration tools, like Google Docs or Etherpad. 

If the project you choose is working primarily on GitHub, you may find it helpful to open a free account on GitHub. This is easy, quick, and, again free! Once you have an account, you can comment on issues and the project lead can add you to tasks. You can also add your changes to the code or content using GitHub. For more on how to use GitHub at the Global Sprint, see these two short, beginner friendly videos **(COMING SOON).**

### Frequently Asked Questions (for Participants)

**Q: I’m not a coder, can I still participate in the Global Sprint?**

A: Definitely! Many of our featured projects need help with design, proofreading, writing, testing applications, and much, much more. Often the best contributions are insights from general users who respond to project ideas and prototypes in a fresh new way.

**Q: How do I find the right project?**

A: Search through the projects [listed on our site](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/). You can also browse projects in the [Global Sprint GitHub repo,](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint/issues) and filter the list using lables.  Projects labeled "beginner" and projects with "good first bugs"  are a great place to start if it's your first Sprint. Read the Contributor Guidelines if available, and reach out to the Project Lead with any questions. 

**Q: How do I find a site near me?**

A: All approved sites will be listed on our website (Site page coming soon!), and you can click on links there to register. You can also register as a remote attendee and participate from the comfort of your home or workplace. Keep an eye on the video checkin times for your timezone-- we'd love for you to join us.

**Q: What is this GitHub thing and how does it work?**

A: Github is a tool for working collaboratively online. It's used for managing projects, defining tasks for contributors, and tracking changes and additions to shared documents, whether that's content (curriculum, documents, event plans, game instructions, etc) or code. See the links above to learn more about GitHub.
