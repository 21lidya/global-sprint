### The Basics
Any project entered in the sprint should:

* have a designated **project lead** who can lead the work before and during the sprint
* allow and **welcome contributions** by Sprint participants
* support the open web and a healthy internet.

In 2017 we're inviting a wide range of projects, from security/privacy tools to scientific software to web literacy curriculum to community events-- nearly anything that supports or builds the open web.  

### The Project Lead Role
The Project Lead role is key for a successful run in the Global Sprint!  All Project Leads should have a good understanding of basic open practices. **We're strongly recommending that all Global Sprint Project Leads take ["Open Leadership 101"](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101) a very short (1-hour) online course covering these concepts.**

Project leads must:

* document and prepare their projects **in advance** of the Sprint
* be available from 9-5 in their local time on the day the Sprint to coordinate project work, answer questions and troubleshoot, and approve contributions and pull requests
* be a welcoming, enthusiastic, and patient project leader

**PLEASE NOTE: By submitting a project, you agree to be available in a virtual and/or in-person capacity on June 1st-2nd from 9-5 in your time zone to field project contributions and promote your project.** 


### Welcoming Contributions & FEATURED Projects!
Every Global Sprint project should be ready to encourage and accept contributions from a group of diverse, skilled and passionate people from around Mozillaâ€™s Network. Welcoming happens on-site at the Sprint, but **good project documentation** enables contributors understand project aims and start collaborating right away. We feature well-documented projects on Mozilla's Network pulse site and in our "Featured Projects" page here on the Global Sprint site, where potential contributors will see them first. (Registered projects appear among our all the projects in our GitHub issue tracker for the Sprint).  
**In past Sprints, FEATURED projects had nearly 5 times as many contributions and active contributors as projects that were simply registered without good documentation.** This [project checklist](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/project-checklist/) covers everything a project needs to be FEATURED.
