### The Basics

In 2017 we're inviting a wide range of projects, from security/privacy tools to scientific software to web literacy curriculum to community events-- nearly anything that supports or builds the open web.  Any project entered in the sprint should:

* have a designated **project lead** who can lead the work before and during the sprint
* allow and **welcome contributions** by Sprint participants
* support the **open web and a healthy internet.**

To REGISTER your project for the sprint, you will need, at minimum:

* a GitHub account
* a GitHub Repository to host your project information. 

This is easy to do! Information about opening a GitHub account and creating a repository are here. You'll also find information about a few extra steps you can do to get your project FEATURED on Network Pulse and here on the Global Sprint site, where potential contributors will see them first. **In past Sprints, FEATURED projects had nearly 5 times as many contributions and active contributors as projects that were simply registered without good documentation.** (Registered projects are listed among our all the projects in our GitHub issue tracker for the Sprint).

### The Project Lead Role
The Project Lead role is key for a successful run in the Global Sprint!  All Project Leads should have a good understanding of basic open practices. **We're strongly recommending that all Global Sprint Project Leads take ["Open Leadership 101"](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101) a very short (1-hour) online course covering these concepts.**

Project leads should:

* document and prepare their projects **in advance** of the Sprint
* **be available from 9-5 in their local time on the days of the Sprint** to coordinate project work, answer questions, and approve contributions and pull requests
* be a **welcoming, enthusiastic, and patient** project leader
