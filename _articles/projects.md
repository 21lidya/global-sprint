### The Basics
Any project entered in the sprint should:

* have a designated **project lead** who can lead the work before and during the sprint
* allow and **welcome contributions** by Sprint participants
* support the open web and a healthy internet.

In 2017 we're inviting a wide range of projects, from security/privacy tools to scientific software to web literacy curriculum to community events-- nearly anything that supports or builds the open web.  

### The Project Lead Role
The Project Lead role is key for a successful run in the Global Sprint!  All Project Leads should have a good understanding of basic open practices. **We're strongly recommending that all Global Sprint Project Leads take ["Open Leadership 101"](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101) a very short (1-hour) online course covering these concepts.**

Project leads must:

* document and prepare their projects **in advance** of the Sprint
* on the day-of, welcome both in-person and online contributors of all levels
* coordinate project work
* answer questions and troubleshoot
* approve contributions and pull requests
* be an enthusiastic, helpful, and patient presence.

**PLEASE NOTE: By submitting a project, you agree to be available in a virtual and/or in-person capacity on June 1st-2nd from 9-5 in your time zone to field project contributions and promote your project.** 


### Welcoming Contributions
Every Global Sprint project should be ready to encourage and accept contributions from a group of diverse, skilled and passionate people from around Mozillaâ€™s Network. Welcoming happens on-site at the Sprint,  but good project documentation enables contributors understand project aims and start collaborating right away. See this checklist of required project documents for the 2017 Sprint.


### Registered vs. FEATURED(!) Projects
Our checklist covers everything a project needs to be REGISTERED for the Sprint. There are also extra, optional items that will level-up your open leadership skills and maximize participation. Complete this next level of preparation and your project will be FEATURED on our Global Sprint page, where potential contributors will see it first.
