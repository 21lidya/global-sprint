**Project leads have a pivotal role in the Global Sprint. Your creativity and your ability to connect and inspire participants draws new ideas and collaborative energy to the event-- and your project! [Register your project here!](https://goo.gl/forms/cH9pQifDvnnYlrd73)** 

As a Project Lead, you should have a basic understanding of open practices, specifically: 

* designing and documenting your project so it’s easy for anyone to understand
* inviting and encouraging participants, welcoming many diverse viewpoints and skill sets
* sharing your process, work and product in a way that makes sense for your project, and documenting how your material may be reused, remixed, and shared further

If some or all of this is new to you, don’t worry! Learning to work and lead open is a process, and you don’t have to do it all at once, or do it perfectly the first time around. To get started, our 1-hour online course, [Open Leadership 101](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101), will provide you with some basic information and tips, and direct you to resources for further exploration. We’re also offering a series of webinars on Working Open at the Sprint-- check back here or ping us in the Gitter chat for the schedule of events. 

In addition to a willingness to work openly, project leads must:
* document and prepare their projects in advance of the Sprint
* be available from 9-5 in their local time on the days of the Sprint to coordinate project work, answer questions, and approve contributions 
* be a welcoming, enthusiastic, and patient project leader
